Installation (State Management Pattern)
------------
- Flux (discovered by facebook)

- Problems (Why might need vuex)
  - cann't use props for sibling components
  - parent to child (props)
  - child to parent (events)
  - complicated

- npm install vuex --save

- in a component,
  - state (script -> data)
  - view (template)
  - actions (script -> methods)

- Adv
  - one single source of truth
  - every components has direct access
  - global state (reactive)
  - 

- Equal Vue instance
  - data (state)
  - mehtods (actions)
  - computed (getters)

  - the diff -> (mutations)
    - commit and track state changes
